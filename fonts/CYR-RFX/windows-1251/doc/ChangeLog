	* misc/10x20: moved the descender in "cyr_sch"/"cyr_Sch" one pixel to
	the right -- to be as in "cyr_ts".

	* misc/10x20 is now iso10646-0400-complete.

2000-08-10  Dmitry Bolkhovityanov  <bolkhov@inp.nsk.su>

	* Made 75dpi/timBI14:"cyr_g" one pixel narrower (removed the middle).

2000-08-09  Dmitry Bolkhovityanov  <bolkhov@inp.nsk.su>

	* Made a number of changes to fix quotation marks (as described
	at http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/quotes.html):

		* Introduced the "-r" switch to cvtbdf.pl, so that it
		rearranges the quotation marks -- interchanges
		"quotesingle"<->"quoteright" and "grave"<->"quoteleft"
		in the destination encoding (so encoding tables were left
		unchanged).  And now Makefiles always use "-r".

		* Redraw the (unencoded) quotation marks in misc/ fonts to
		comply with the standard.

		* Had to change the 0x22 in misc/{7x14,7x14B,8x16,12x24},
		since the doublequote was way too wrong...

		* In fact, such a "simple" decision isn't ideal, since
		the glyphs look different in different font families
		(e.g. "quoteleft" is "upper single 6" in tim* and is
		"upper reversed 9" in cour*).  But it is definitely
		better than nothing.

2000-08-09  Dmitry Bolkhovityanov  <bolkhov@inp.nsk.su>

	* 75dpi/tim* family is koi8-o-complete.

	* Fixed a bug in mkaliases.pl, which made encoding-aliases in the
	form "adobe-times..." instead of "-adobe-times...".

2000-08-08  Dmitry Bolkhovityanov  <bolkhov@inp.nsk.su>

	* 100dpi/tim*12 are done and koi8-o- 1251-complete.

	These (100dpi/*12) fonts are used by Netscape as 17pt 75dpi fonts
	when AllowScaling=yes (Size=14, <BIG>This is 17pt</BIG>).

	But checking them with testtext.html was a knightmare ;) -- Netscape3
	didn't want to use them "as is" (i.e. after just adding koi8-1/100dpi
	to fontpath) -- probably due to the fontdirs ordering.  And when I
	added 100dpi:unscaled and 100dpi to fs/config just after
	75dpi:unscaled, it began to draw text with empty glyphs...  Finally
	I hacked the test bdfs for POINT_SIZE to be 170 instead of 120, and
	Netscape began to use them as usual 75dpi ones.  (What a bugware!)

	We probably need a "-7" ("100->75dpi") switch in cvtbdf.pl, so that
	it could create 75dpi fonts out of 100dpi, correctly changing
	FONT, POINT_SIZE, SESOLUTION_X and RESOUTION_Y.  (Just changing
	the ptSz in FONT with mk100to75aliases.pl doesn't help...)

2000-08-01  Dmitry Bolkhovityanov  <bolkhov@inp.nsk.su>

	* 75dpi/lu* family is koi8-o- and 1251-complete.

	* Additionally, the look of 75dpi/lu{IS,BIS}* fonts had changed:
	the "cyr_v", "cyr_t", "cyr_soft" and its derivatives are of more
	"handwritten" style, like in Office Type Sans.

2000-07-25  Dmitry Bolkhovityanov  <bolkhov@inp.nsk.su>

	* Corrected the "g with upturn" (both up- and lowcase) in 75dpi/luBS19,
	where they had no upturns (those were forgot to be added after copying
	from "g").

2000-07-16  Dmitry Bolkhovityanov  <bolkhov@inp.nsk.su>

	* 75dpi/tim* family is 1251-complete.

	* 75dpi/timR12: added top-right serif to "cyr_k" (was missing after
	copying from "k").

2000-07-13  Dmitry Bolkhovityanov  <bolkhov@inp.nsk.su>

	* Some corrections in 75dpi/timB08: DWIDTH in "cyr_f" was wrong,
	plus "cyr_m" looked a bit ugly (added a pixel for boldness).

	* General corrections in 75dpi/helvR14: added "edge-fattening"
	pixels to many glyphs, mainly "cyr_ch" family, "cyr_soft" family
	("soft", "yeru", "hard", "semisoft", "ve", "ze", "ya" and alikes).

2000-06-04  Dmitry Bolkhovityanov  <bolkhov@inp.nsk.su>

	* Big changes in a naming/aliasing:

		* cvtbdf.pl can now autorename fonts, e.g.
		"b&h-lucida=rfx-serene".  The main use is for b&h-lucida*
		fonts -- due to copyright reasons they are renamed to
		RFX-Serene*, with appropriate aliases created afterwards.

		* All the aliasing code in makefiles is replaced with a
		single "mkaliases.pl" script, which is in particular
		capable of back-aliasing b&h-lucida*->rfx-serene*.

		* Since mkaliases.pl can accept multiple encoding-aliases,
		some encodings now have two sets of aliases: koi8-ru and
		koi8-ub have "koi8-r,koi8-u", and winlatin-1 -- "iso8859-1,
		microsoft-cp1252" aliases.

2000-05-14  Dmitry Bolkhovityanov  <bolkhov@inp.nsk.su>

	* The "mainsize" fonts (misc/7x14, 75dpi/{courR14,helvR14,luRS12,
	lutRS12,ncenR14,timR14}) are iso10646-0400-complete.

2000-05-08  Dmitry Bolkhovityanov  <bolkhov@inp.nsk.su>

	* Introduced the "koi8-o" (old-Cyrillic) encoding.  It is based on
	koi8-ub, with "izhitsa", "yat" and "fita" added.

	* All the misc/ fonts are koi8-o-complete.

2000-04-16  Dmitry Bolkhovityanov  <bolkhov@inp.nsk.su>

	* Version 1.1:

	* The "koi8-ub" (Ukrainian-Byelorussian-Russian) and "bulgarian-mik"
	encodings added.

        * Added the registry-encoding alias "microsoft-cp1251"->"windows-1251".

2000-03-20  Dmitry Bolkhovityanov  <bolkhov@inp.nsk.su>

	* The version number is added to all the .tgz-filenames
	(cyr-rfx-ENCODING-VERSION.tgz and cyr-rfx-ENCODING-VERSION.bdfs.tgz).

2000-03-15  Dmitry Bolkhovityanov  <bolkhov@inp.nsk.su>

	* Changed the name from "CYR_RFX" to "CYR-RFX", since Metalab
	(ex-SunSite) and FreshMeat discourage use of "_".
	Updated all the filenames and docs to reflect this change.

2000-03-05  Dmitry Bolkhovityanov  <bolkhov@inp.nsk.su>

	* Removed the README.{en,ru}.txt files which were accidentally
	left sitting in the doc/.

2000-02-16  Dmitry Bolkhovityanov  <bolkhov@inp.nsk.su>

	* Slightly modified the encodings: koi8-1 now has an additional
	"space" at 0x9A (for compatibility with koi8-r), and koi8-ru
	has an additional "space" at 0xA0 (for compatibility with
	iso8859-*.

2000-01-24  Dmitry Bolkhovityanov  <bolkhov@inp.nsk.su>

	* Switched off the "&B" fndry-suffix and made appropriate
	modifications in the documentation.

	* Version 1.0 release.

2000-01-23  Dmitry Bolkhovityanov  <bolkhov@inp.nsk.su>

	* Performed some proofreading of all fonts:
		1) checked the "Euro" sign to resemble the canonical
		   shape;
		2) checked the "rouble" sign to have dot;
		3) made custom versions of "Edieresis"/"edieresis" and
		   "Idieresis"/"idieresis" for "YO"/yo" and "YI"/"yi" in
		   some fonts, where standard glyphs were too different
		   from unaccented ones or the dieresis was poorly
		   represented.

2000-01-22  Dmitry Bolkhovityanov  <bolkhov@inp.nsk.su>

	* The whole tim* family is koi8-complete.
	So, *ALL* the fonts are cyrillized.

2000-01-06  Dmitry Bolkhovityanov  <bolkhov@inp.nsk.su>

	* The whole helv* family is koi8-complete.

2000-01-04  Dmitry Bolkhovityanov  <bolkhov@inp.nsk.su>

	* The whole cour* family is koi8-complete.

1999-12-31  Dmitry Bolkhovityanov  <bolkhov@inp.nsk.su>

	* Italics/obliques are done up to 14pt in tim* and cour*, and up to
	18pt in helv*.  So, now, at the end of 1999, there are only 10
	font-files left before the total koi8-completeness.

1999-12-28  Dmitry Bolkhovityanov  <bolkhov@inp.nsk.su>

	* Modified the appearance of "Euro" sign in a number of misc/
	fonts to resemble the canonical shape.

1999-12-20  Dmitry Bolkhovityanov  <bolkhov@inp.nsk.su>

	* All the lu{IS,BIS}* fonts are koi8-complete.  So, the "lu"
	family is finished.
	Yes!  I did it!

1999-12-16  Dmitry Bolkhovityanov  <bolkhov@inp.nsk.su>

	* Erased an artefact in the "capital CH" in timB18.

1999-11-29  Dmitry Bolkhovityanov  <bolkhov@inp.nsk.su>

	* The first *italic* "lu" font is koi8-complete -- luIS14.
	So, the shape of italic "lu" fonts is defined.

1999-11-06  Dmitry Bolkhovityanov  <bolkhov@inp.nsk.su>

	* The "CAPITAL_CYRILLIC_I" and its derivatives were corrected
	in the tim[RBI]14.bdf fonts.

1999-11-03  Dmitry Bolkhovityanov  <bolkhov@inp.nsk.su>

	* All the lu[RB]S{08,10,12,14,18,19,24}.bdf files are koi8-complete.
	So, now we have *all* roman and bold (non-italic/non-oblique) fonts.

1999-11-02  Dmitry Bolkhovityanov  <bolkhov@inp.nsk.su>

	* All the tim[RB]{08,10,12,14,18,24}.bdf files are
	koi8-complete.

	* Some proofreading performed. Slightly changed a few glyphs
	for better legibility and corrected the DWIDTH parameter in
	some glyphs. The fonts affected are helvR08, helvR10, helvB08,
	helvB10, helvB12, helvB14, helvO10, helvO12, luRS14, luBS12,
	luBS18, timR08, timR14, timR18, timR24, timB08, timB10, timB12,
	timI10. 

1999-10-26  Dmitry Bolkhovityanov  <bolkhov@inp.nsk.su>

	* All lut[RB]S{08,10,12,14,18,19,24}.bdf files are koi8-complete.
	So, the very first goal of the project is reached. 

1999-10-24  Dmitry Bolkhovityanov  <bolkhov@inp.nsk.su>

	* HTML'ized the README-files.

	* Added the installation instructions -- doc/INSTALL.{en,ru}.txt.

1999-10-22  Dmitry Bolkhovityanov  <bolkhov@inp.nsk.su>

	* Added the doc/ directory to webpage and to distribution
	tarballs.

	* Created the logo -- doc/cyr_rfx_logo.gif.

1999-10-12  Dmitry Bolkhovityanov  <bolkhov@inp.nsk.su>

	* Set up a webpage for CYR_RFX at
	http://www.inp.nsk.su/~bolkhov/files/fonts/cyr_rfx/

1999-10-11  Dmitry Bolkhovityanov  <bolkhov@inp.nsk.su>

	* Added winlatin-1 and iso8859-15 encodings (both are latin
	with a Euro sign).
