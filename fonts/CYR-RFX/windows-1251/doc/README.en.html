<A NAME="S_1.5"><BR CLEAR=all><H3 ALIGN=left><FONT FACE="lucida, verdana, arial, helvetica">&sect;1.5.&nbsp;What does "CYR-RFX" mean?</FONT></H3>

<P>"CYR-RFX" means CYRillic Raster Fonts for X.




<A NAME="S_1.6"><BR CLEAR=all><H3 ALIGN=left><FONT FACE="lucida, verdana, arial, helvetica">&sect;1.6.&nbsp;What are the aims of CYR-RFX project?</FONT></H3>

<P>The aim of CYR-RFX is to create a collection of quality cyrillic
versions of standard raster fonts for X-Window.

<P>The first task was to create russified versions of a few
LucidaTypewriter fonts to use them in xterm and text editors.

<P>Later the task was extended -- to create such a collection of fonts
which could cover most X-Window applications.  The following apps are
treated as most important: xterm, text editors, Netscape, XV, LyX,
window managers and GUIs (fvwm/<WBR>fvwm2/<WBR>AnotherLevel, AfterStep,
KDE, GNOME), Motif, Athena, Athena3D, Qt and XForms interface
libraries.

<P>(The fonts which are used were found in a trivial way:
"<TT>grep&nbsp;-i&nbsp;font</TT>" on all files from <TT>/etc/X11</TT> and
<TT>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults</TT> dirs, plus using
<TT>strings|less</TT> on program executables and shared libraries.)




<A NAME="S_1.7"><BR CLEAR=all><H3 ALIGN=left><FONT FACE="lucida, verdana, arial, helvetica">&sect;1.7.&nbsp;Cyrillic fonts for X already exist &#40;Cronyx for example&#41;, so what's the need in CYR-RFX?</FONT></H3>

<P>One of the goals of CYR-RFX is the development of <I>accurate
cyrillic versions of standard X fonts</I>.

The Cronyx package (the <TT>fonts/cyrillic/</TT> dir in the XFree86
distribution) presents some problems.  First, it contains fonts not
from X, but, it seems, from Windows 3.x (see [<A HREF="#bib_CRONYX">CRONYX</A>]). 
Second, these fonts aren't the most aestetic and eye-pleasing.  Third,
the metrics in many of these fonts are bad, so the text rendered in
different fonts (both in a mix of Cronyx/ISO8859-1 and in Cronyx only)
looks "ugly". (It is due to wrong values of <TT>FONT_ASCENT</TT>
properties, and the mismatch of glyphs' heights in different fonts with
a same value of <TT>PIXEL_SIZE</TT> -- for example, in
courier-medium-r-normal--14 and times-medium-r-normal--14.)

<P>The author is far from slanding on the Cronyx fonts -- some time ago
it was the only choice, and they helped very much, but now something
better is required.

<P>The second set of cyrillic fonts, known to the author (this set can
be named as "75dpi.koi8-1" [<A HREF="#bib_75DPI_KOI8">75DPI_KOI8</A>]) is made by adding
cyrillic glyphs to the standard X fonts. But, first, it doesn't include
the Lucida/<WBR>Lucidatypewriter and monospaced <TT>misc/</TT> fonts, and,
second, the glyph images often differ significantly from the same
standard russian font (that one which is used in "paper" typography). 
Additionally, this set of fonts is "anonymous" -- at least, all its
distributions, which are available to the author, contain no notion of
creators.



<A NAME="S_1.8"><BR CLEAR=all><H3 ALIGN=left><FONT FACE="lucida, verdana, arial, helvetica">&sect;1.8.&nbsp;TrueType rasterisers for X have recently appeared, and there is a plethora of cyrillic .ttf fonts, so what's the need in CYR-RFX?</FONT></H3>

<P>Vector fonts (TrueType and Postscript) are ideal for large
resolutions, but for low resolutions (xterm, text editors, www, window
titles etc.) the hand-tuned raster fonts are much better. They are used
for these purposes not only in X, but also in Windows and MacOS.

<P>Additionally, the most available TrueType fonts are those which are
distributed with MS Windows and are part of MS Fontpack
[<A HREF="#bib_MS_FONTPACK">MS_FONTPACK</A>].  But, despite that they are "free", they are
not free software.  So, they are virtually unacceptable for use in
Unices, since, for example, they can't be included into distributions
due to weird format (.exe-files) and their very "jesuitical" license
(see [<A HREF="#bib_MS_EULA">MS_EULA</A>]).



<A NAME="S_1.9"><BR CLEAR=all><H3 ALIGN=left><FONT FACE="lucida, verdana, arial, helvetica">&sect;1.9.&nbsp;Which fonts are included in the CYR-RFX?</FONT></H3>

<P>Currently all the <FONT FACE="arial, helvetica">iso8859-1</FONT> fonts from <TT>misc/</TT>, plus
Lucida, LucidaTypewriter, Times, Helvetica and Courier from
<TT>75dpi/</TT> are cyrillized.  The NewCenturySchoolbook and
<TT>100dpi/</TT> fonts are taken into account for future.  This choice of
fonts is conditioned by their most frequent usage.



<A NAME="S_1.10"><BR CLEAR=all><H3 ALIGN=left><FONT FACE="lucida, verdana, arial, helvetica">&sect;1.10.&nbsp;Which set of glyphs and which encodings are included in CYR-RFX?</FONT></H3>

<P>First the aim was to make glyphs from <FONT FACE="arial, helvetica">koi8-1</FONT> encoding
[<A HREF="#bib_KOI81">KOI81</A>]  (including "Euro"), later ukrainian glyphs from
<FONT FACE="arial, helvetica">koi8-ru</FONT> [<A HREF="#bib_KOI8RU">KOI8RU</A>] were added, and, finally, as less
needed, the rest cyrillic glyphs from <FONT FACE="arial, helvetica">windows-1251</FONT>/WGL4
[<A HREF="#bib_WIN1251">WIN1251</A>,<A HREF="#bib_WGL4">WGL4</A>].  The author doesn't have a task to
make all cyrillic glyphs from the Unicode standard -- only the most
used.

<P>The <TT>misc/</TT> and <TT>75dpi/lut[RB]S{08,19,24}.bdf</TT> fonts have
the following glyphs (which are present in <FONT FACE="arial, helvetica">koi8-1</FONT> and in Adobe
standard encoding) added:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>
        dagger, daggerdbl, guilsinglleft, guilsinglright, emdash,
        endash, ellipsis, quotesinglbase, quotedblbase, grave,
        quotesingle, quotedblleft, quotedblright, tilde, florin,
        perthousand, bullet, trademark, circumflex; OE, oe, Scaron,
        scaron, Zcaron, zcaron, Ydieresis.
</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In other fonts these chars were already present as "unencoded
glyphs".

<P>Monospace LucidaTypewriter and Courier fonts have linedrawing chars
in the range <I>0x00-0x1F</I> added, so that these fonts can be used in
xterm and alikes (the author prefers <TT>lutRS12</TT>).

<P>Some LucidaTypewriter fonts have also "images" of control chars from
<I>0x00-0x1F</I> plus <I>0x7F</I> (<TT>delete</TT>) added.  The goal is
that in those applications, which display text not interpreting control
chars (text editors, xfte for example), and in xterm when printing
chars from this range without special meaning, something would appear,
instead of absolutely nothing.

<P>In standard Lucida and LucidaTypewriter fonts, and in most fonts
from <TT>misc/</TT> the <TT>DEFAULT_CHAR</TT> property
[<A HREF="#bib_BDF">BDF</A>,<A HREF="#bib_XLFD">XLFD</A>] has a value of <I>0</I>.  So, in the
LucidaTupewriter and

<TT>misc/{10x20,<WBR>12x24,<WBR>6x10,<WBR>6x13B,<WBR>7x14,<WBR>7x14B,<WBR>8x13,<WBR>8x13B,<WBR>8x16,<WBR>9x15,<WBR>9x15B}</TT>

fonts the <I>0x00</I> char was added, looking as a filled rectangle (it
was already present in other <TT>misc/</TT> fonts).  And in Lucida (more
precisely, in all with <TT>DEFAULT_CHAR=0</TT> and missing 0x00 char)
the value of <TT>DEFAULT_CHAR</TT> was changed to <TT>32</TT>, for
nonexistent glyphs to be displayed as space (initially in Lucida* from
X11R6.3 even the <I>0xA0</I> glyph (nbsp) was missing, which is wrong).

<P>Currently the following encodings are present:

</TABLE>
</CENTER>

<P>The <FONT FACE="arial, helvetica">winlatin-1</FONT> encoding (also known as <FONT FACE="arial, helvetica">cp-1252</FONT> and
<FONT FACE="arial, helvetica">windows-1252</FONT>) is a superset of <FONT FACE="arial, helvetica">iso8859-1</FONT>, and contains
additional glyphs in the range <I>0x80-0x9F</I>.  Sometimes web-pages
crafted under Windows in <FONT FACE="arial, helvetica">cp-1252</FONT> are transferred with
<TT>charset=iso-8859-1</TT> header [<A HREF="#bib_CZY_CP1252">CZY_CP1252</A>].

<P>The <I>0-127</I> range is identical to <FONT FACE="arial, helvetica">ISO8859-1</FONT> in all
encodings.

<P>Since the ready-to-use font files are generated programmatically,
other encodings can be added easily.




<A NAME="S_1.11"><BR CLEAR=all><H3 ALIGN=left><FONT FACE="lucida, verdana, arial, helvetica">&sect;1.11.&nbsp;How fonts in CYR-RFX are named?</FONT></H3>

<P>All the fonts have the same names as standard ones, with a few
changes.

<OL>

<LI>The XLFD-suffix <TT>rgstry-encdng</TT> "ISO8859-1" is replaced
with that which reflects the encoding (e.g. "koi8-1").




<LI>Additionally, for fonts in <FONT FACE="arial, helvetica">koi8-1</FONT>, <FONT FACE="arial, helvetica">koi8-ru</FONT>,
<FONT FACE="arial, helvetica">winlatin-1</FONT> and <FONT FACE="arial, helvetica">iso8859-15</FONT> encodings the aliases with
<TT>rgstry-encdng</TT> "koi8-r", "koi8-u", "iso8859-1" and "iso8859-1",
respectively, are autogenerated.  In these aliases the real encoding
name is appended to the <TT>fndry</TT> field.  For example, for the font


<P><BLOCKQUOTE>-adobe-times-medium-r-normal--14-140-75-75-p-74-winlatin-1</BLOCKQUOTE>

the alias

<P><BLOCKQUOTE>-adobe_winlatin_1-times-medium-r-normal--14-140-75-75-p-74-iso8859-1</BLOCKQUOTE>

is generated.

<LI>And, finally, the aliases from original <TT>fonts.alias</TT> files are
retained (of course, with appropriate target name modification).  For
example, <TT>6x13</TT> and <TT>fixed</TT> "point" to

<P><BLOCKQUOTE>-misc-fixed-medium-r-semicondensed--13-120-75-75-c-60-koi8-1</BLOCKQUOTE>

</OL>

<P>Such approach enables to ease cyrillization of most standard
programs, which usually use either wildcards without encoding, or
aliases like "7x14", "fixed" etc.  In most cases it is sufficient to
place a directory with cyrillic fonts into beginning of FontPath, and
these fonts will be used instead of <FONT FACE="arial, helvetica">iso8859-1</FONT> ones
automatically.



<A NAME="S_1.12"><BR CLEAR=all><H3 ALIGN=left><FONT FACE="lucida, verdana, arial, helvetica">&sect;1.12.&nbsp;How the names of glyphs &#40;which are specified in STARTCHAR&#41; were chosen?</FONT></H3>

<P>Mainly the standard Adobe names were used.  It applies to glyphs
from <I>0x20-0x7E</I>, to cyrillic glyphs (<TT>afiiNNNNN</TT>), to glyphs
from <FONT FACE="arial, helvetica">ISO8859-1</FONT> range <I>0xA0-0xBF</I>, to "<TT>Euro</TT>" and
additional punctuation from Adobe standard encoding range.  The
"number" sign was named <!--"<TT>numero</TT>" instead of uninformative-->
"<TT>afii61352</TT>", the "rouble" sign was named "<TT>rouble</TT>".  The
linedrawing chars got the names <TT>ldXXXXX</TT>, as was suggested by the
<TT>75dpi/tech14.bdf</TT> (-DEC-Terminal-*-DEC-DECtech) font, the
<I>0x00</I> is "<TT>null</TT>", and the rest glyphs from <I>0x00-0x1F</I>
are named "<TT>ctrlX</TT>", where "X" is a char with the same code plus
0x40. The <I>0x7F</I> glyph is named "<TT>delete</TT>".  The non-breaking
space char <I>0xA0</I> is named space, as Adobe standard encoding
[<A HREF="#bib_AGL">AGL</A>] suggests.

<P>Glyphs which don't have Adobe name were named <TT>uniXXXX</TT>
according to [<A HREF="#bib_UGN">UGN</A>].




<A NAME="S_1.13"><BR CLEAR=all><H3 ALIGN=left><FONT FACE="lucida, verdana, arial, helvetica">&sect;1.13.&nbsp;How the CYR-RFX fonts are created?</FONT></H3>

<P>The fonts are created in two steps.

<P>First the standard .bdf font from XFree86 distribution (the
<TT>xc/fonts/bdf/*/</TT> dirs) is taken, than cyrillic and other missing
glyphs are added (the main russian -- in the <FONT FACE="arial, helvetica">koi8</FONT> positions,
others -- in the relatively randomly selected positions  from
<I>0x80-0x9F</I>; it is named a "source encoding").  The fonts are
edited with a slightly modified XmBDFEd 3.0 (sometimes assisted by
XPaint).

<P>Than a special assembler program written in Perl (it is called
<TT>cvtbdf.pl</TT>) reads both the new file with cyrillics and a standard
ISO8859-1 file, and creates a file with a font in requested encoding
(<FONT FACE="arial, helvetica">koi8-1</FONT>, <FONT FACE="arial, helvetica">windows-1251</FONT> etc.).

<P>Since XmBDFEd 3.0 handles the headers of some fonts in a "too
intellectual" manner, the headers (and the <TT>DWIDTH</TT> parameter for
monospace fonts) are taken from an ISO8859-1 font.  During this process
the "<TT>FONT</TT>" header is modified, and the values of <TT>FNDRY</TT>,
<TT>CHARSET_REGISTRY</TT> and <TT>CHARSET_ENCODING</TT> properties are
replaced. Additionally, the <TT>COPYRIGHT2</TT>, <TT>SOURCEDATE</TT> and
<TT>ASSEMBLER</TT> properties are being added.



<A NAME="S_1.14"><BR CLEAR=all><H3 ALIGN=left><FONT FACE="lucida, verdana, arial, helvetica">&sect;1.14.&nbsp;Which princilpes are used when creating cyrillic glyphs for CYR-RFX?</FONT></H3>

<P>This is covered in §3 in detail, but briefly, <I>the glyphs should
correspond to the style of the font as close as possible</I>.



<A NAME="S_1.15"><BR CLEAR=all><H3 ALIGN=left><FONT FACE="lucida, verdana, arial, helvetica">&sect;1.15.&nbsp;Why are YOU doing cyrillization?  Are you an expert in fonts?</FONT></H3>

<P>I just got tired of very "rough" and unergonomic fonts (plus very
unesthetic ones).  Since definitely nobody tried to fix the
situation, I decided to do it myself.

<P>I began creating/cyrillizing raster fonts in the end of 80s on
BK-0010, Yamaha MSX and AT286 computers, so the gained experience gave
me right to predict a good result.
